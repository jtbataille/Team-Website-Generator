## Description
This application uses Node CLI to take in information from the user regarding his/her workplace team to render an HTML webpage with the information given. The desired information has overlap as well as differentiate based on the job-type. For example, while all job titles will be asked for a name, ID, and email, a manager will be asked for his/her office number, an intern for his/her school, and an engineer for his/her GitHub profile URL.

This information will then be used to create cards and render an HTML page which can be used to centralize this information for the team and/or for any other interested party.
